# Editor

(Very) simple editor for tilesets. Can also create collisions.

## Usage

A lot of values are hardcoded such as the tileset's size and the tile's size.

You can pass `--load` and `--save` to the executable to, respectively, load `level0.lvl` on start and save to `level0.lvl` when the application close.
